      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="text-content">TIt’s safe to say that the introduction of the Black Panther to Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War” brought a shout of joy and triumph to lips of many a comic book fan, as did the announcement of actor Chadwick Boseman in the role. For Boseman, it’s an immersion in a brand-new world, for which he appears more than up to the task.</p>
        <p class="text-content">
         “You meet me as the Prince of Wakanda,” he says of his character’s debut in the film. “You meet me as a politician/monarch, not as a super hero. [But,] I am already a Black Panther.”Boseman’s entry into the established Marvel Cinematic Universe came as something of a surprise to him, albeit a pleasant one.Boseman’s known for playing real-life historical figures such as James Brown and Jackie Robinson, but cites his personal favorite thing about portraying the Black Panther.
